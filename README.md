# My-own-Wooler
Conversion Tool. 
Input: Crochet Hook and Yarn Size, 
Output: (always 10cmx10cm): Rows in most common stitches

## Summary

In Crochet some Patterns require a sample usually 10cm/10cm in according stitch and wool. BUT these require the EXACT same wool as displayed, same hooksize and tension as the creator. unlikely scenario.
More likely: You have wool and a matching (to the wool) Hook ( there are recommended hooksizes on most wools) , now what? Make a sample, see it doesn't add up, redo: trial-and-error, you can't unravel it for some reason ETC... FRUSTRATION
I want to solve it with my Idea. so you just ask the My-own-Wooler : I have these, how do I adjust my pattern and still get THAT result? ( Sizes of scarfs, Beanies, mittens etc. where size matters)


## Background

You can imagine, I HATE samples. They never completely unravel, the wool goes wacky after unraveling and I loose time, lots and lots of time. Along with my motivation.
So taking (forced) an AI course, I actually got interested, BUT the math is far beyond me (too abstract, I'm creative and hands-on).
So I thought if you can predict m√∂kki prices and tictactoe, why not predict a yes/no ( like excel, but with) Text. which I learned IS possible.
Crochet Community is a lovely place, we're creative, we share, we show our tricks and tips (from starting out to Pro) just go check ALL the tiktoks on chunky stuffies (Amigurumi)
and I can't (yet) write my own patterns (math...reinventing the wheel...) BUT I want to contribute my part.
This IS my part. Work smarter, not harder. ;)

## How is it used?
Also what I would love this look like one day :)))



Here's a few codes I think? they could be useful, but DONT think I know how to make it work:(
So here's all values I can deliver



 *input values hooksize, woolsize OR Recommended Hooksize<p></p>
  Predict Yes/ No 10/10cm = how many stitches in height<p></p> 
  Chain = 1 <p></p>            
  Single Crochet = Chain * 2<p></p> 
  Double Crochet = = Chain * 3 <p></p>

    return a - b + c - d ``

import numpy as np

x = np.array([0,1,2,3])<p></p> 
c = np.array([9,8,7])<p></p> 

print(x @ c)

```

## Challenges

with different wool and hooks, your yardage (how much yarn is used) will be different too. sadly there's no gurarantee to to yardage, but there's usually a yardage on the banderole or a gram/meter ratio. 
Also this works for height ONLy, because the lenght of a Chain of Stitches does vary, but not clearly, Double crochets are wider than Singles or Chains


# What next?

If this actually works I would bring it out EVERYWHERE I can reach, humanely possible.
